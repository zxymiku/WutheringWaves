# WutheringWaves

Wuthering Waves server emulator (0.9.0)

## How to run
- Compile and run SDKServer and GameServer using dotnet8 (Visual Studio 2022 recommended)

## Connecting
- Get game client from somewhere. For example using official launcher (you can find it in our discord)
- [Download and extract patch](https://nogatekeep.ing/assets/ww/0.9.0/WuWa-0.9-patch.zip) to the game folder, it will redirect all http requests to `127.0.0.1:5500`
- Run game and connect to the server
